# LOST-DATA-RETRIEVAL
RecoverPy is a powerful tool that leverages your system capabilities to recover lost files.  • Unlike others, you can not only recover deleted files but also overwritten data.  • Every block of your partition will be scanned. You can even find a string in binary files. 
# Key Features
# Comprehensive Data Recovery: Supports retrieval of lost data from hard drives, SSDs, USB drives, and other storage media.
# User-Friendly Interface: Built using the textual library to provide an intuitive and interactive terminal-based user interface.
# Automated Dependency Management: Ensures all necessary dependencies are installed and up-to-date, enhancing user experience and minimizing setup complexities.
# Detailed Logging: Implements robust logging mechanisms to track the recovery process, providing valuable insights and troubleshooting information.
# Modular Design: Utilizes a modular approach, making it easy to extend and customize for various data recovery scenarios.

# Technical Details
Technology Stack
# Python: The primary programming language used for its versatility and extensive library support.
# Recoverpy: A specialized library for data recovery tasks, providing the core functionalities required for this project.
# Textual: A modern, asynchronous framework for creating terminal applications, used to build the user interface.

# Core Components
Dependency Management

# is_dependency_installed: A helper function to check if the necessary dependencies are installed.
# install_and_push_modal: A function that handles the installation of missing dependencies and provides feedback to the user via a modal interface.
Logging

# log: A logging utility to record events, errors, and other relevant information throughout the data recovery process.
User Interface

# App Class: Derived from textual.app.App, this class manages the application lifecycle, including initializing the UI and handling user interactions.


# How It Works
Initialization:

The application starts by checking if all required dependencies are installed. If not, it attempts to install them, ensuring the environment is properly set up.
User Interaction:

Users interact with the application through a terminal-based interface. They can select the storage device and initiate the data recovery process.
Data Recovery Process:

The Recoverpy library performs the actual data recovery, scanning the selected device for lost or corrupted data and attempting to restore it.
Logging and Feedback:

Throughout the process, detailed logs are maintained to provide transparency and aid in troubleshooting. Users receive real-time feedback on the progress and outcome of the recovery process.
Usage
# Installation:

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies using pip.
bash

# Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application:

Start the application by running the main script.
bash
Copy code
recoverpy.py
Interacting with the Application:

Follow the on-screen instructions to select the storage device and initiate the data recovery process.
Future Enhancements
Support for Additional File Systems: Extend support to a wider range of file systems to enhance compatibility.
Advanced Recovery Options: Implement advanced recovery options such as deep scans and selective file recovery.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Develop a GUI version of the application for users who prefer a graphical interface over a terminal-based one.

# Conclusion
Lost Data Retrieval is a powerful and user-friendly solution for recovering lost data, combining the strengths of Python, Recoverpy, and textual. Whether dealing with accidental deletions, corrupted files, or other data loss scenarios, this tool provides an effective means to restore valuable information with ease.
